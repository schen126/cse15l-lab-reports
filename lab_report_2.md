# Part 1: StringServer 🧶🖥️
I started by copying the [code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet) provided by Professor Politz during Lab 2 into a new repo so I could edit it, which included the code for [`Server.java`](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet/blob/master/Server.java) and [`NumberServer.java`](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet/blob/master/NumberServer.java). The former would build a web server using HttpServer, and the latter would actually handle URL requests. I copied and used `Server.java` as is, but renamed and edited `NumberServer.java` to handle Strings instead of numbers.
As I was working on a new computer that did not have GitHub Desktop installed, I followed the following steps:
1. Go to [GitHub's website](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the `.exe` file to install the app

2. After opening the app, log in to your account
3. Select a repository to clone, which will download a copy of that repo onto your local computer. In my case, I chose my `cse15L_lab_report_code` repo

4. Following that, open the repo in Visual Studio Code ([download instructions](https://github.com/schen126/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/lab_report_1.md) in Lab Report 1)
> After making changes to the code locally, make sure to `push` the change so the main version (on GitHub) will be modified
