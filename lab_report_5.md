## Lab Report 5
*By Serena Chen*

---
My favorite lab report was `Lab Report 3`, which correlates to the lab in Week 4 (the document for our group can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8dxYHgvIFSqXOY1R09R4HYT-B3YAbPKHE-gGwP9d4s/edit#heading=h.doiztlgw6k3t)). This [lab report](https://schen126.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/lab_report_3.html) focused on the `grep` command, which is a powerful tool that allows the user to search for a pattern in files. Because of its many variations, I found it fascinating and very useful. In the [lab of week 4](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week9/), we looked for files in a directory using `grep`, and put this info into a script. I didn't complete the last section of the lab, which involved the Search Server. To expand upon `Lab Report 3` and the lab in week 4, I'll first explore more commands with `grep`, then describe and review the process of the lab, then complete the Search Server section of the lab.
