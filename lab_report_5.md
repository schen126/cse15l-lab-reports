## Lab Report 5
*By Serena Chen*

My favorite lab report was `Lab Report 3`, which correlates to the lab in Week 4. This lab report focused on the `grep` command, which is a powerful tool that allows the user to search for a pattern in files. Because of its many variations, I found it fascinating and very useful. In the lab of week 4, we looked for files in a directory using `grep`, and put this info into a script.
