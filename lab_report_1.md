# Installing VSCode
I actually already installed VSCode before for CSE 11, but I remember the steps are like this:
1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click `Download for Windows`

2. Click on the downloaded file
3. Allow the publisher to make changes to your computer
4. Select the default option for everything
5. Download VSCode and open it up!
